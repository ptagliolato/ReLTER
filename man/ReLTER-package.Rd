ReLTER provides access to DEIMS-SDR (https://deims.org/), and allows interaction with data and software implemented by eLTER Research Infrastructure (RI) thus improving data sharing among European LTER projects. ReLTER uses the R language to access and interact with the DEIMS-SDR archive of information shared by the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) network. This package grew within eLTER H2020 as a major project that will help advance the development of European Long-Term Ecosystem Research Infrastructures (eLTER RI - https://elter-ri.eu). The ReLTER package functions in particular allow to: - retrieve the information about entities (e.g. sites, datasets, and activities) shared by DEIMS-SDR (see e.g. get_site_info function); - interact with the ODSEurope (maps.opendatascience.eu) starting with the dataset shared by DEIMS-SDR (https://deims.org/) (see e.g. the get_site_ODS() function); - use the eLTER site informations to download and crop geospatial data from other platforms (see e.g. get_site_ODS function()); - improve the quality of the dataset (see e.g. get_id_worms()). Functions currently implemented are derived from discussions of the needs among the eLTER users community. The ReLTER package will continue to follow the progress of eLTER-RI and evolve, adding new tools and improvements as required.
