Description: ReLTER provides access to DEIMS-SDR (https://deims.org/),
    and allows interaction with data and software implemented by eLTER
    Research Infrastructure (RI) thus improving data sharing among European 
    LTER projects.
    ReLTER uses the R language to access and interact with the DEIMS-SDR
    archive of information shared by the Long Term Ecological Research (LTER)
    network. This package grew within eLTER H2020 as a major project that will
    help advance the development of European Long-Term Ecosystem Research
    Infrastructures (eLTER RI - https://elter-ri.eu).
    The ReLTER package functions in particular allow to:
    - retrieve the information about entities (e.g. sites, datasets, and
    activities) shared by DEIMS-SDR (see e.g. get_site_info function);
    - interact with the [ODSEurope](maps.opendatascience.eu)
    starting with the dataset shared by [DEIMS-SDR](https://deims.org/)
    (see e.g. [get_site_ODS](https://docs.ropensci.org/ReLTER/reference/get_site_ODS.html)
    function);
    - use the eLTER site informations to download and crop geospatial data
    from other platforms (see e.g. get_site_ODS function);
    - improve the quality of the dataset (see e.g. get_id_worms).
    Functions currently implemented are derived from discussions of the
    needs among the eLTER users community.
    The ReLTER package will continue to follow the progress of eLTER-RI
    and evolve, adding new tools and improvements as required.
