<p>Taking into account the guide on <a href="./site_information.html">“How to obtain site info?”</a>, here is
offered two examples on how to aggregate information of many eLTER
sites.</p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="firstExample">By get_network_* functions:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#firstExample"></a>
</h2>
<p>Through the 5 functions developed for get network information, access
and download of some information of an entire eLTER network can be
made.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="get-general-information-of-the-networks-sites">Get general information of the network’s sites:<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#get-general-information-of-the-networks-sites"></a>
</h3>
<p>Knowing the network elTER id (DEIMS ID of the Network,
e.g. LTER-Italy <a href="https://deims.org/network/7fef6b73-e5cb-4cd2-b438-ed32eb1504b3" class="external-link uri">https://deims.org/network/7fef6b73-e5cb-4cd2-b438-ed32eb1504b3</a>),
the <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/ReLTER/reference/get_network_sites.html"><code>get_network_sites</code></a>
can download general info, such as name, DEIMS.iD and coordinates of the
sites belonging to the network selected. A map of the sites can be
returned.</p>

<p>Another 4 functions are been implemented to obtain network’s sites
information. Each functions get specific information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Environmental characteristics by <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/ReLTER/reference/get_network_envcharacts.html"><code>get_network_envcharacts</code></a>
</li>
<li>Observed properties by <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/ReLTER/reference/get_network_observedProperties.html"><code>get_network_observedProperties</code></a>
</li>
<li>Related resources by <a href="https://docs.ropensci.org/ReLTER/reference/get_network_related_resources.html"><code>get_network_related_resources</code></a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following example perform the request to get all related
resources (e.g. activities, datasets, etc.) of the network. The output
is a table containing the title, id and time stamp of the last changes
of the related resources shared by the network’s sites.</p>
